# Game modes in 0.1.4 (before "For Science!")

### Enabling Game Mode menu
Step 1:
  Get the instance of `CreateCampaignMenu` (there are two instances, either should be fine - I tried only the first one.)
Step 2:
  Run (through UE or a patch) `KSPUtil.SetActive(createCampaignMenu._gameModesMenu, true)`
Step 3:
  Populate the menu by calling `createCampaignMenu._gameModeMenuScript.Enable(createCampaignMenu, "SandboxMode")`, and you're done.

### Adding game modes
You can add a game mode by patching the GameModeManager's `Initialize()` method and adding your game mode to `_allGameModes`.
